As highlighted on the [wiki's homepage](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot/wiki), Pythagora Pro is the recommended choice for most users. It's the quickest way to begin building your application, optimized to use the best LLM models available.

If you're a visual learner, [this tutorial is also available in video form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ9VvFwL_a4).

## Getting Started

### Step 0: Install Pythagora
Install the Pythagora VS Code extension from the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PythagoraTechnologies.pythagora-vs-code). You can also click on the extension icon in VS Code, then search for 'pythagora', then click the blue 'Install' button:

If you need help during installation, this [quick YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30gThyt8T4Y) will guide you through the process. After installing the extension, click on the Pythagora icon on the left-hand extensions sidebar in VS Code:

### Step 1: Create Your Account
Sign up for your Pythagora account using Google Authentication:

### Step 2: Access Settings
Access Pythagora's settings by clicking the gear icon:

On the settings page, you can check your current version of the Pythagora extension and GPT Pilot (the Pythagora Core version number). Here, you'll also see details such as whether Pythagora Pro credits are applied to your account, if an API key is configured, or if a notification indicates "You are out of credit" prompting setup actions.

### Step 3: Setting Up Pythagora

You will be asked if you will like to develop with Pythagora's `Local` or `Cloud` development mode. [This article explains more about both development options](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot/wiki/Developing-locally-verses-in-the-cloud-with-Pythagora). 

On the Pythagora settings page, the `Pythagora Core path` section displays the directory where Pythagora's Core files are installed. 

If you selected to develop with Pythagora's `Cloud` mode, this section will show `/pythagora/`. If you chose Pythagora's `Local` development mode, you will need to click the `Change` button to select a new, empty directory on your machine.

### Step 4: Manage Your Subscription
To get started with Pythagora Pro, go to the Pythagora's settings page and click the `Upgrade` button. You'll receive an email with setup instructions. Once Pro is activated, restart VS Code and Pythagora should now display that you're on a Pro plan and how many remaining credits your account has.

Alternatively, if you prefer using your own API keys from a LLM provider, follow these instructions to [use Pythagora with your own API key](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot/wiki/Using-the-Pythagora-VS-Code-extension-with-your-own-API-key).

### Step 5: No Configuration Needed
If you've signed up for Pythagora Pro, no further configuration or changes to the `config.json` file are needed. Pythagora Pro is already configured to use the most efficient LLMs from various providers, selecting the best model for each task.
