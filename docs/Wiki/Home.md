# Welcome to the Pythagora/GPT Pilot Wiki!

This wiki will guide you through how to use Pythagora and GPT Pilot. In addition to the articles below, we also have a [playlist on YouTube on how to use Pythagora like a pro](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbi3WiEeXr2wdppQ575zSLbcORou-Lxd1) and more videos on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pythagoraa).

We also just launched Pythagora v1. For more info, please read [How to upgrade from Pythagora beta to Pythagora v1](https://github.com/Pythagora-io/gpt-pilot/wiki/How-to-upgrade-from-Pythagora-beta-to-Pythagora-v1)

## Overview

- **Pythagora**: A powerful [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PythagoraTechnologies.pythagora-vs-code) built on top of GPT Pilot, designed to simplify app development.
- **GPT Pilot**: The open-source core technology that powers Pythagora, available for exploration and customization.

## Getting Started

If you're eager to start building right away, we recommend using **Pythagora Pro**:

### Pythagora Pro

**Pythagora Pro** is the prepaid version of Pythagora, optimized for builders and makers. It’s designed to be user-friendly and highly effective, removing the need for manual configuration.

Our development team continuously tests and updates Pythagora Pro to ensure it leverages the best and most efficient LLM models available. For the best performance, we suggest subscribing to Pythagora Pro and using it as-is, without modifying or changing any of the configurations.

With Pro, you will also have access to Pythagora Chat in the sidebar which allows you to ask questions about your application, as the chat understands the context of your application.

### GPT Pilot

**GPT Pilot** is ideal for users who want to dive deeper into the technology behind Pythagora. By cloning the GPT Pilot repository, you can explore and run the code directly from the command line or through the Pythagora VS Code extension.

You can use your own API keys from your preferred LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) when running GPT Pilot. If you run GPT Pilot within Pythagora using your own API keys, a Pythagora Pro subscription isn’t required; however, you may incur costs from your chosen LLM provider.
